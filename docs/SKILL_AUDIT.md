# Skill / Architecture Alignment Audit (2026-04-26, re-checked 2026-04-27)

Snapshot of where the agent skills under `agents/{generation,verification}/.agents/skills/` and their host `AGENTS.md` files agree or disagree with `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`. Keep this file as a punch-list — once an item is fixed, mark it done with the commit hash.

**Re-check note (2026-04-27)**: F1, F3, and (partially) F4 were already addressed by commit `514a44c "Align skill contracts with Phase I agent design"` before this audit was written. They are kept here for history but marked **resolved**. F7–F11 are new findings from the re-check.

## Scope audited

- `agents/generation/.agents/skills/`: 9 skills
  (obtain-immediate-conclusions, search-math-results, query-memory,
  construct-toy-examples, construct-counterexamples,
  propose-subgoal-decomposition-plans, direct-proving,
  recursive-proving, identify-key-failures)
- `agents/verification/.agents/skills/`: 3 skills
  (check-referenced-statements, verify-sequential-statements,
  synthesize-verification-report)
- `agents/generation/AGENTS.md`, `agents/verification/AGENTS.md`
- `agents/generation/mcp/server.py` (MCP tool surface + channel registry)
- `agents/generation/.codex/config.toml` and the
  `subgoal-prover` sub-agent definition
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §6.2, §6.3 (and structural refs back to §3 / §4 / §5)

## Real inconsistencies

### F1 — Verifier skill ordering (AGENTS.md vs ARCH §6.3)
- **ARCH §6.3 line 1944-1946**: `check-referenced-statements`,
  `verify-sequential-statements`, `synthesize-verification-report`.
- **`agents/verification/AGENTS.md` line 55-57**: same order.
- **Status**: **resolved** in commit `514a44c` (pre-dates this audit).
  Re-check on 2026-04-27 confirms both files match.

## MCP channel surface drift

### F2 — `big_decisions` is a dead channel
- Original gap: registered in MCP but no producers, consumers, or
  documented purpose.
- **Status**: resolved. Wired per Option B (see "big_decisions design
  proposal" below). Producers: `identify-key-failures` (strategic
  pivots), `propose-subgoal-decomposition-plans` (materially different
  plan sets). Consumers: `propose-subgoal-decomposition-plans` (avoid
  re-pursuing abandoned strategies), `query-memory` (now lists it).

### F3 — `query-memory` underdocuments queryable channels
- Original gap: `subgoals` and `proof_steps` missing from the channel
  list.
- **Status**: **resolved** in commit `514a44c`. The current skill
  enumerates all 8 non-`big_decisions` channels.

### F4 — `recursive-proving` mixes MCP tools and Codex multi-agent tools in one list
- **Status**: resolved. The Tools section is now split into "## MCP
  Tools" and "## Codex Sub-agent Tools" with the latter explicitly
  citing `agents/generation/.codex/config.toml` as the source.

## Skill content gaps

### F5 — `verify-sequential-statements` does not explicitly cover empty proof for `definition` / `external_theorem`
- ARCH §6.3 mandates: "For definitions: Stage 2: vacuously passing
  (empty proof — no step-by-step to verify)" and the same for
  `external_theorem`.
- The skill step 2 only addresses proof-requiring kinds:
  > If kind is `lemma`, `proposition`, or `theorem` and proof is empty
  > or unusable, record a gap before any further checking.
- For the other two kinds the skill is silent. The implicit
  conditional-fall-through is correct, but the absence of a positive
  rule invites a Codex run to mis-classify a definition's empty proof
  as a gap.
- **Status**: resolved. Skill step 2 now positively states that for
  `definition` / `external_theorem` an empty proof is expected and
  per-step proof verification is skipped.

### F6 — `direct-proving` and `recursive-proving` both produce `<node>` blocks but neither restates the §6.2 batch contract
- ARCH §6.2 enforces: no `external_theorem` from generator; non-empty
  `statement`; content-descriptive labels (no placeholders); target
  label must appear; no rewriting non-target existing labels;
  `\ref{}` per dep; intra-batch DAG.
- The "Batch Output Contract" section of `agents/generation/AGENTS.md`
  carries this. The two skills tell sub-agents to "assemble candidate
  `<node>` blocks" without referencing that contract.
- `recursive-proving` only ships the assigned plan + stuck points to
  each sub-agent (step 3); if the sub-agent's prompt context loses
  AGENTS.md, the produced `<node>` blocks may violate the schema and
  waste a batch.
- **Status**: resolved. `recursive-proving` step 3 now spells out the
  full §6.2 batch contract inline (kind allow-list, label
  prefix/placeholder rules, target-must-appear, write-scope, DAG, etc.)
  so sub-agents see it even when AGENTS.md is not in context.
  `direct-proving` step 8 carries the same restatement before
  `<node>` block assembly.

## Re-check findings (2026-04-27)

### F7 — Append-only MCP can't represent the status mutations skills assume
- `propose-subgoal-decomposition-plans` line 48 declares
  `"status": "proposed|screening|screened|selected|failed|solved"`,
  implying a mutable field per `plan_id`.
- `direct-proving` line 57: "Update the corresponding decomposition-plan
  record in `subgoals` to `screening`, `screened`, or `solved`."
- But `agents/generation/mcp/server.py` exposes only `memory_append` —
  there is no `memory_update`. JSONL files are append-only.
- A literal reading produces multiple records with the same `plan_id`
  and different `status`. `memory_search` does not dedupe by `plan_id`
  and ranks ties by ascending `timestamp_utc` (older first; see F11),
  so a status query may return stale state ahead of fresh.
- Same shape applies to `branch_states` (`branch_update` is just
  `memory_append`), and to `counterexamples` "mark impacted
  branches/lemmas as invalid" wording.
- **Status**: resolved. Took option (a):
  - `propose-subgoal-decomposition-plans` Output Contract now spells
    out the append-only + newest-wins convention.
  - `direct-proving` "Update the corresponding decomposition-plan
    record" wording now says "append a fresh record with the same
    `plan_id` and the new `status`".
  - `recursive-proving` `branch_states` update step calls out that
    `branch_update` is append-only and that callers should reuse
    stable `branch_id` values across rounds.
  - `memory_search` ranking change in F11 makes newest-first the
    default tie-break, so the convention "Just-Works" without extra
    reader logic.

### F8 — Record IDs (`plan_id`, `branch_id`, `subgoal_id`) have no allocator
- Skills require these IDs but no skill or `AGENTS.md` says how to
  derive them. Agents must invent values.
- Across rounds (or across sub-agents in `recursive-proving`)
  collisions are possible — there is no namespace, no monotonic
  counter, no UUID convention.
- The MCP server does not validate uniqueness either.
- **Status**: resolved. ID-derivation rules added to
  `propose-subgoal-decomposition-plans` (`plan_id = "plan-{N}"`),
  `identify-key-failures` (`decision_id = "decision-{N}"`). Both rules
  use `memory_search` to find the largest existing suffix and increment
  by one, with a documented note that the MCP server does not enforce
  uniqueness. `branch_id` derivation stays caller-driven because
  `branch_update` is the only writer and branches are typically named
  by the agent for human-readability — but the skill now mentions
  reusing stable values across rounds.

### F9 — `problem_id` has no documented source
- `query-memory`, `obtain-immediate-conclusions`, and every skill that
  goes through `memory_append`/`memory_search` need a `problem_id`.
- `agents/generation/AGENTS.md` does not mention `problem_id`.
- `generator/prompt.py` (the prompt composer) emits no `problem_id`
  field; `JobRecord` has no such field; no env var carries it.
- The Codex agent therefore has nothing to pass except whatever it
  invents. Two skill calls within the same run could pick different
  values and shard the workspace memory.
- A natural source is `rec.target` (per-target memory persists across
  repair rounds; cross-target memory is separate). But the design
  needs to commit to that explicitly.
- **Status**: resolved. `generator/prompt.py:_problem_id_for` derives
  `problem_id` from the dispatched target via the same sanitisation
  rule as `agents/generation/mcp/server.py:sanitize_problem_id`
  (e.g. `lem:foo` → `lem_foo`). A new `## Memory scope` section in
  the prompt surfaces the derived value verbatim. `AGENTS.md` now
  has a "Memory scope" subsection telling agents to read the
  prompt-supplied value and not invent one. Test:
  `tests/unit/test_m6_prompt.py::test_memory_scope_section_surfaces_problem_id`.

### F10 — `memory_search` returns wrapped records but skills show plain shapes
- `memory_append` wraps the agent's record:
  `{"timestamp_utc": ..., "channel": ..., "record": {<agent fields>}}`.
- `memory_search` returns each hit as
  `{"score": float, "item": <wrapped record>}`.
- Skill output_contract examples (e.g. `propose-subgoal-decomposition-plans`)
  show only the inner record shape `{"plan_id": ..., "status": ...}`.
- An agent that follows the skill literally will look for `plan_id` at
  the top level of search hits and miss it (it lives under
  `result["item"]["record"]["plan_id"]`).
- **Status**: resolved. `memory_search` now unwraps server-side: each
  hit is `{score, timestamp_utc, channel, item: <agent record>}` so
  the `item` shape matches what the skill output_contracts describe.
  System metadata moved to sibling keys. BM25 scoring now runs against
  the inner `record` only, removing the timestamp-string vocabulary
  bias. AGENTS.md "Memory scope" subsection documents the shape.

### F11 — `memory_search` ties ranked older-first
- `agents/generation/mcp/server.py:283-289`:
  `sorted(zip(items, scores), key=lambda pair: (-pair[1], pair[0].get("timestamp_utc", "")))`.
- BM25 score descending (correct), tied scores ascending by
  `timestamp_utc` — i.e. older record first.
- For status-mutating channels (F7) that means the stale record
  outranks the fresh one when both match the query equally.
- For `failed_paths`, `counterexamples`, `immediate_conclusions` the
  effect is mild (older finding has equal weight). For `subgoals` and
  the proposed `big_decisions` channel the effect compounds F7.
- **Status**: resolved. `memory_search` now sorts by descending BM25
  score with descending `timestamp_utc` as the tiebreaker (newest
  first). Implemented as a stable two-pass sort: secondary key
  (timestamp) descending first, then primary key (score) descending.
  Underwrites the F7 "latest wins" convention.

## Second-pass findings (2026-04-27, post F-fixes)

### G1 — `subgoals.status` enum had values without producers
- Original enum: `proposed|screening|screened|selected|failed|solved`.
- Producers existed only for `proposed` (propose-...),
  `screening`/`screened`/`solved` (direct-proving). `selected` and
  `failed` were dead.
- **Status**: resolved. Dropped `selected` (no natural transition).
  Added `failed` producer in `recursive-proving` step 9: when all plans
  fail, append a fresh subgoals record per failed plan_id with
  `status: "failed"`.

### G2 — Skill orchestration was implicit
- `direct-proving` exit on screened-without-solving had no
  next-skill hook; `construct-counterexamples` post-refute had no
  hook either. Other handoffs (e.g. identify-key-failures →
  propose-...) were already covered.
- **Status**: resolved. AGENTS.md now has a "Typical run" subsection
  under Skill Selection laying out the 8-step default loop.
  `direct-proving` and `construct-counterexamples` each grew a
  "## Next Skill" section spelling out exit conditions.

### G3 — `branch_id` lifecycle undocumented
- 7 skills referenced `branch_id: optional`, `branch_states` channel
  existed, `branch_update` was the writer — but no skill or AGENTS.md
  defined what a branch was, when one was opened, or who owned it.
- **Status**: resolved. AGENTS.md "Branches" subsection introduces
  `branch_id` allocation rule, the `state.status` vocabulary
  (`invalid` / `completed`), and the "verified nodes are not branch
  state" boundary.

### G4 — Sub-agents shard memory because they don't see `## Memory scope`
- Parent's prompt has the F9 "## Memory scope" section, but
  `spawn_agent(input=...)` only forwards `input` — sub-agents don't
  see the parent prompt by default. F9 fix re-opened for sub-agents.
- **Status**: resolved. `recursive-proving` step 3 now requires the
  parent to forward the literal `problem_id` value plus an explicit
  instruction to use it for every memory call.
  `agents/generation/.codex/agents/subgoal-prover.toml`'s
  `developer_instructions` carries the same rule as a backstop.

### G5 — `decision_type` enum values were unexplained
- The 4 values (`strategy_pivot|abandonment|reformulation|elevation`)
  appeared in the schema with no semantic guidance, inviting
  miscategorisation.
- **Status**: resolved. `identify-key-failures` now defines each
  value with concrete trigger conditions and notes about which fields
  matter for that type.

### G6 — "mark impacted branches/lemmas as invalid" was unactionable
- `construct-counterexamples` step 5 used the phrase but pointed at
  no MCP tool. There is no `mark_invalid` action.
- **Status**: resolved. Step 5 now spells out the
  `branch_update(problem_id, branch_id, {status: "invalid", reason,
  refuted_by})` call. Candidate scratch-memory lemmas inside the
  branch get a fresh `proof_steps` record with
  `subgoal_status: "stuck"`. Verified `knowledge_base/nodes/` lemmas
  are explicitly out of scope (verifier verdict pipeline owns them).

### G7 — `repair_count` advisory but no skill operationalised it
- AGENTS.md said "small/large repair_count" without thresholds; no
  skill described how to act on the value.
- **Status**: resolved. AGENTS.md "Repair Mode" now has a concrete
  heuristic: `repair_count <= 2` → local repair via direct-proving;
  `>= 3` OR recurring critical_error OR `critical` verdict →
  identify-key-failures + reformulating plan.

### G8 — Two unrelated `status` fields on direct-proving records
- `proof_steps.status` (per-subgoal: `solved|partial|stuck`) and
  `subgoals.status` (per-plan: `screening|screened|solved|failed`)
  shared a name despite being different concepts.
- **Status**: resolved. Renamed `proof_steps.status` →
  `proof_steps.subgoal_status`. Per-plan `status` on `subgoals`
  records keeps its name. Skill text now flags the distinction
  explicitly.

### G9 — Empty-proof rule duplicated between AGENTS.md and skill
- F5 added the rule to `verify-sequential-statements` step 2; verifier
  AGENTS.md line 72-74 already had a near-identical sentence. Two
  sources of truth, drift risk.
- **Status**: resolved. Verifier AGENTS.md now defers the procedural
  detail to the skill (single source of truth) and keeps only a
  one-sentence summary plus the cross-reference.

## Third-pass findings (2026-04-27, post G-fixes)

### H1 — ARCH §8 channel list missing `big_decisions`
- F2 wired the channel through skills, but the canonical channel list
  in ARCHITECTURE.md §8 still listed only 8 channels.
- **Status**: resolved. ARCH §8 now lists 9 channels and includes a
  one-paragraph note on `big_decisions` producers/consumer.

### H2 — `proof_steps.attempt_type` enum was undefined
- direct-proving hard-coded `attempt_type: "direct"`; G6 added a new
  context (counterexample refutation) with no schema follow-through.
- **Status**: resolved. Enum spelled out as
  `direct|recursive|counterexample_refutation`. Sister-skill writers
  documented inline in direct-proving (recursive-proving sub-agents,
  construct-counterexamples G6 stuck records). construct-counterexamples
  step 5 sets `attempt_type` explicitly.

### H3 — Six generator skills lacked an explicit "Next Skill" exit
- G2 added Next Skill sections to direct-proving and
  construct-counterexamples; the other six (obtain-immediate-conclusions,
  construct-toy-examples, search-math-results, query-memory,
  propose-subgoal-decomposition-plans, identify-key-failures,
  recursive-proving) still relied on inline hooks scattered through
  procedure steps.
- **Status**: resolved. Every generator skill now has a `## Next Skill`
  section spelling out exit conditions.

### H4 — `proof_steps` channel was an undocumented reader-side
- direct-proving wrote it; identify-key-failures and recursive-proving
  said "direct-proving stuck points" without naming the channel.
- **Status**: resolved. Both Input Contracts now name `proof_steps`
  with the appropriate `attempt_type` filter.

### H11 — propose-... did not read prior failed plans
- G1 added `status: "failed"` records to `subgoals` but the planner
  did not read `subgoals` itself — only `failed_paths` and `branch_states`.
- **Status**: resolved. Input Contract now reads prior `subgoals`
  records with `status="failed"` filter.

### H12 — ARCH referenced a non-existent `resolve-reference` skill
- Two stale mentions in ARCH §5 / §6.3 of a `resolve-reference` skill
  that doesn't exist (likely renamed to `check-referenced-statements`).
- **Status**: resolved. Both mentions point at `check-referenced-statements`.

### H13 — `external_reference_checks.status` example showed only 2 of 5 values
- Skill schema example listed `missing_from_nodes|not_applicable`,
  hiding the other three values from anyone reading by example.
- **Status**: resolved. Example enumerates all 5 with one-line
  definitions of each per ARCH §6.3.

### H14 — `verify-sequential-statements` step 6 used `critical_error` but `checked_items.status` accepts `critical`
- The category name and the schema enum value diverged; an agent
  literally writing `status: "critical_error"` mismatched the
  synthesize-... output_contract.
- **Status**: resolved. Step 6 now classifies as `gap` or `critical`
  to match `checked_items.status` directly.

### H15 — `verify-sequential-statements` Output Contribution didn't show `gaps[]`/`critical_errors[]` shape
- Skill produced `checked_items` entries but the parallel
  `{location, issue}` shape for the per-class lists was implicit.
- **Status**: resolved. Output Contribution now shows the
  `{location, issue}` example and pairs it with the corresponding
  `checked_items` entry.

### H16 — F5 fix accidentally re-stated `\ref{}` resolution responsibility
- `verify-sequential-statements` step 2 said to "check that any
  `\ref{label}` resolves" — but that's `check-referenced-statements`'
  job and creates duplication.
- **Status**: resolved. def/external_theorem rule tightened to
  statement-coherence-only and explicitly defers ref resolution to
  `$check-referenced-statements`.

### H17 — `subgoal_id` and other IDs had no derivation rule
- `subgoal_id` appeared as `optional` in 6 record schemas but no skill
  said how to allocate one. `branch_id` was partially documented
  (G3); `plan_id` and `decision_id` had per-skill rules with drift
  risk.
- **Status**: resolved. AGENTS.md "Identifier conventions" subsection
  is the single source of truth: a 5-row table covering `plan_id`,
  `subgoal_id`, `branch_id`, `decision_id`, and a footnote that
  one-shot records (counterexamples, immediate_conclusions) are
  identified by content + `timestamp_utc` and need no ID.

### H18 — `failed_paths` had four producers with ad-hoc shapes
- direct-proving, construct-counterexamples, recursive-proving, and
  identify-key-failures all wrote to `failed_paths`. Only
  identify-key-failures had an explicit `record_type` field.
- **Status**: resolved. Each producer now writes a record with an
  explicit `record_type` tag (`plan_stuck`,
  `counterexample_refuted`, `recursive_round_failed`,
  `key_failures_summary`). Readers still BM25-search; record_type
  is for write-side consistency and downstream filtering.

### H19 — Identifier derivation rule duplicated between skill and AGENTS.md
- After H17, `plan_id` and `decision_id` derivation lived in both
  AGENTS.md and the producing skills. Drift risk like G9.
- **Status**: resolved. Per-skill blocks now defer to AGENTS.md
  "Identifier conventions"; the table is the single source of truth.

## Fourth-pass findings (2026-04-27, post H1-H19 fixes)

### H20 — ARCH §6.2 "Prompt composition" missing the Memory scope step
- F9 added a "Memory scope" section to `generator/prompt.py` and
  `agents/generation/AGENTS.md`, but ARCH §6.2 still listed only
  six prompt parts. A reader of ARCH alone could not know that
  `## Memory scope` is part of the dispatch contract — the very
  problem F9 was meant to close.
- **Status**: resolved. ARCH §6.2 "Prompt composition" now lists
  Memory scope as item 2 (renumbering subsequent items 3-7); the
  derivation rule defers to `sanitize_problem_id` in
  `agents/generation/mcp/server.py` so there is one canonical
  source.

### H23 — Default ``-m auto`` flag fails on ChatGPT-account login
- After H22 the workers correctly loaded the Phase I agent dir, but
  every dispatch still failed with ``ERROR: {"detail":"The 'auto'
  model is not supported when using Codex with a ChatGPT account."}``.
  The default codex argv hard-coded ``-m auto``; the CLI flag
  overrides ``model = "..."`` from ``.codex/config.toml`` and the
  ChatGPT-login server rejects ``auto`` as a model name.
- **Status**: resolved. ``generator/role.py`` and ``verifier/role.py``
  no longer pass ``-m auto``. The per-agent ``.codex/config.toml``
  carries ``model = "gpt-5.4"`` (etc.) and codex picks it up via the
  ``-C <agent_dir>`` flag. Operators with a different account or
  model preference can still override via ``--codex-argv``. Static
  guard in ``tests/unit/test_agent_phase1_contract.py`` blocks the
  flag from sneaking back in.

### H22 — Worker codex invocation read-escapes the workspace
- `generator/role.py` and `verifier/role.py` invoked
  ``codex exec -m auto --sandbox read-only <prompt>`` with no ``cwd``,
  no ``-C``, and no ``--add-dir``. Codex therefore inherited the
  worker process's cwd (the workspace) and resolved ``.codex/`` /
  ``AGENTS.md`` from there upwards. Two failures followed:
  1. **Wrong agent contract.** The workspace has no ``.codex/`` or
     ``AGENTS.md`` of its own, so codex fell back to the user-global
     ``~/.codex/config.toml``. The Phase I MCP server, the Phase I
     skill set, and the Phase I prompt instructions never loaded.
     The agent improvised, exploring files instead of emitting
     ``<node>`` blocks; decoder rejected every batch with
     ``no_nodes_in_batch`` (H21 reason).
  2. **Read-escape into sibling projects.** ``--sandbox read-only``
     blocks writes but does not cap reads. The agent ran
     ``rg --files ..`` and found ``../Rethlas/agents/generation/...``
     — the upstream Rethlas snapshot in the operator's directory.
     It then partially imitated the *old* (pre-Phase-I) blueprint
     workflow, which is exactly the cross-project pollution the
     workspace was supposed to isolate.
- **Status**: resolved. ``rethlas init`` now materializes
  ``<workspace>/agents/{generation,verification}/`` from the source
  repo (``common/runtime/agents_install.py``). ``generator/role.py``
  and ``verifier/role.py`` invoke codex with ``cwd`` inside the
  materialized agent dir and pass ``-C <agent_dir> --add-dir
  <workspace>`` so the writable / reachable scope is bounded to
  workspace-resident paths. Static guards in
  ``tests/unit/test_agent_phase1_contract.py`` pin the
  materialization layout and the wrapper-side argv shape.

### H21 — Decoder rejection surface undercounted in docs
- `generator/decoder.py` exports 12 `REASON_*` constants and ships
  a dedicated unit test for each (`tests/unit/test_m6_decoder.py`),
  but PHASE1 M6 listed only "11 failure modes" and ARCH §6.2's
  "Decoder failure modes" bullet list named just 7 of them
  (`malformed_node`, `forbidden_kind`, `prefix_kind_mismatch`,
  `existing_non_target_label`, `placeholder_label`, `ref_unresolved`,
  the unnamed repair-no-change). The missing five
  (`no_nodes_in_batch`, `duplicate_label_in_batch`, `target_mismatch`,
  `self_reference`, `cycle`) lived in adjacent paragraphs or only
  in code, so a reader could not reconcile the documented surface
  with the test matrix.
- **Status**: resolved. ARCH §6.2 now enumerates all 12 reasons by
  their canonical `REASON_*` string, links the bullet list to the
  separate cycle / repair-no-change paragraphs, and adds the
  invariant that any new rejection mode must add a constant + bullet
  + dedicated unit test. PHASE1 M6 updated to "12 failure modes" and
  the empty-batch case now appears in the test list.

## Already-aligned design (sanity-check pass)

These were verified against ARCH and pass — no action needed:

- `verify-proof` skill removed from `agents/generation/.agents/skills/`
  (commit history). Aligns with §6.2 "Generator must not call any
  verifier service".
- `agents/verification/api/server.py` and
  `agents/verification/mcp/server.py` deleted. Aligns with §6.3 "The
  old verifier mcp/ and api/ service paths are not active Phase I
  components".
- All three verifier skills explicitly forbid MCP / web / arXiv /
  events / runtime. Aligns with §6.3 information boundary.
- All nine generator skills write only via `memory_append` to MCP
  scratch channels. Aligns with §6.2 "Skills may write only to
  generator MCP scratch memory".
- Label → filename rule (`:` → `_`) in
  `check-referenced-statements` matches the §6.3 table exactly.
- Verdict three-state logic in `synthesize-verification-report` step 2
  agrees with §6.3 across all four (gaps × critical_errors)
  combinations.
- The five `external_reference_checks.status` values
  (`verified_in_nodes`, `verified_external_theorem_node`,
  `missing_from_nodes`, `insufficient_information`, `not_applicable`)
  match between §6.3 and the verifier skills.
- `recursive-proving` enforces a single layer of sub-agents
  (step 5), aligning with §6.2 "at most one internal exploration
  layer per generator run".
- `verifier.run_completed.verification_hash` defense-in-depth: the
  skill instructs Codex to echo the prompt's value, and
  `verifier/role.py:222-227` overrides with `rec.dispatch_hash` at
  publish time regardless. Two independent enforcements of the
  hash-match contract.
- "One batch per attempt" parent-emit rule
  (`recursive-proving` step 8) aligns with §6.2 "one complete `<node>`
  batch emitted on stdout for the wrapper to decode and publish as
  one `generator.batch_committed` event".

## big_decisions design proposal

### Question
`big_decisions` is registered in MCP but has no readers or writers.
Two options:

#### Option A — delete the channel
- One-line edit in `agents/generation/mcp/server.py:CHANNEL_FILES`.
- No skill changes required.
- YAGNI-pure: nothing in Phase I needs it.
- Risk: zero (currently dead code).

#### Option B — define a clear role and wire it in
The niche it would fill: **cross-round strategic pivots and
abandonments** — material decisions that change the search direction
for an entire problem, separate from per-plan subgoals
(`subgoals`), per-subgoal attempts (`proof_steps`), per-plan failure
syntheses (`failed_paths`), and meta-log entries (`scratch_events`).

Concretely, Phase I generator currently has these reasoning
artefacts but no place to record decisions like:
- "Round 2 abandoned the induction-on-rank approach after both
  proposed plans hit the same SU(2)-character obstruction. Switch to
  compactness."
- "Reformulating the target as a counter-example proof —
  `repair_count >= 3` and the induction angle keeps producing the
  same gap."
- "Elevate constraint X from a per-plan assumption to a top-level
  invariant the next planning round must respect."

These belong in their own channel because they are *not* failures
themselves (those go to `failed_paths`) and are *not* per-plan
records (those go to `subgoals`). They are the rationale for the
strategic shift between planning rounds.

**Proposed contract**:

```json
{
  "decision_id": "...",
  "round": 0,
  "decision_type": "strategy_pivot|abandonment|reformulation|elevation",
  "summary": "...",
  "previous_approach": "...",
  "new_approach": "...",
  "drove_by": {
    "failed_plan_ids": ["..."],
    "key_failures": ["..."],
    "counterexamples": ["..."]
  },
  "implications_for_next_plans": ["..."]
}
```

**Producers**:
- `identify-key-failures` — when the synthesized failures call for a
  strategic pivot rather than another local plan iteration. Append a
  `big_decisions` record alongside the existing `failed_paths`
  summary record.
- `propose-subgoal-decomposition-plans` — when the new plan set is
  materially different from prior rounds (e.g. switches the proof
  technique or rewrites the target as a counter-example). Append a
  `big_decisions` record describing the pivot before publishing the
  new plans.

**Consumers**:
- `propose-subgoal-decomposition-plans` should pull recent
  `big_decisions` via `memory_search` to avoid re-pursuing
  abandoned strategies.
- `query-memory` should list `big_decisions` as a queryable channel
  (and update its skill text accordingly).
- Repair-mode prompt composition (in `generator/role.py`) could
  optionally summarize recent `big_decisions` so the next round
  doesn't relitigate them.

### Recommendation
**Option B**, with the caveat that it requires four touch points:
1. New skill text in `identify-key-failures` and
   `propose-subgoal-decomposition-plans` to write
   `big_decisions` records (with the schema above).
2. Update `query-memory` channel list (also closes F3).
3. Optional: enrich repair prompt composition to surface them.
4. Add a one-paragraph note in ARCH §6.2 acknowledging the channel
   so future readers can find its purpose.

If the repair prompt enrichment turns out unwanted, reduce to
Option A — the cost is just deleting the registry entry. Phase I
should not carry an undocumented dead channel either way.

## Audit method

For reproducibility, the audit walked through:
1. List every `SKILL.md` under both agents directories.
2. Diff stated tools / channels against
   `agents/generation/mcp/server.py`'s actual surface.
3. Trace each skill's "Procedure" section against ARCH §6.2 / §6.3
   for matching invariants.
4. For verifier skills, additionally cross-check verdict logic and
   information boundary against §6.3.
5. For generator skills, verify scratch-only writes (no `events/`,
   `runtime/`, `knowledge_base/`, Kuzu writes) per §6.2.

A future re-audit should re-run all five steps and append findings
under a new dated heading rather than rewriting prior entries.
