# Rethlas

Rethlas is a natural-language reasoning system for mathematics built around two Codex agents:

- The generation agent reads a math problem from a markdown file and writes an informal proof blueprint.
- The verification agent checks that proof blueprint, produces a structured verdict, and serves as the generation agent's verifier.

The intended deployment order is:

1. Start the verification agent as a local HTTP service.
2. Run the generation agent through Codex.
3. Let the generation agent call the verification service during its proof-and-repair loop.

## Repository Layout

- `agents/generation`: the proof-generation agent
- `agents/verification`: the proof-verification agent



## 1. Install Codex CLI

Install the Codex CLI:

```bash
npm install -g @openai/codex
```


## 2. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/frenzymath/Rethlas.git
cd Rethlas
```

## 3. Start the Verification Service


```bash
cd agents/verification
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn api.server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8091
```


## 4. Run the Generation Agent on the Included Example


```bash
cd agents/generation
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r mcp/requirements.txt
./tests/run_example.sh
```

This script:

- reads `agents/generation/data/example.md`
- runs `codex exec` inside `agents/generation`
- writes the run log to `agents/generation/logs/example/example.md`
- writes memory artifacts to `agents/generation/memory/example/`
- writes the draft proof to `agents/generation/results/example/blueprint.md`
- writes the verified proof to `agents/generation/results/example/blueprint_verified.md` if verification succeeds

## 5. Run Your Own Problem

Put your problem in a markdown file under `agents/generation/data/`. Save that as:

```text
agents/generation/data/my_problem.md
```

Then run:

```bash
cd agents/generation
source .venv/bin/activate
PROBLEM_FILE=data/my_problem.md ./tests/run_example.sh
```

The filename stem becomes the generation problem id. In this example:

- problem id: `my_problem`
- memory directory: `agents/generation/memory/my_problem/`
- draft proof: `agents/generation/results/my_problem/blueprint.md`
- verified proof: `agents/generation/results/my_problem/blueprint_verified.md`
